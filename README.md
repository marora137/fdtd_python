## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

### Install fdtd_python in Development mode

``` sh
# make sure fdtd_python package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to fdtd_python
$ nbdev_prepare
```

## Usage

## How to use

Define the refractive index and thickness of the layers in the
simulation. The refractive index is defined as a list of lists of coefficients to the sellmeier equation, and the
thickness is defined as a list of floats. The length of the two lists
must be equal.

``` python
SiO2 = [0, 0.6961663, 0.0684043, 0, 0.4079426, 0.1162414, 0, 0.8974794, 9.896161, 0]
AlO3 = [0, 1.4313493, 0.0726631, 0, 0.65054713, 0.1193242, 0, 5.3414021, 18.028251, 0]
n = [AlO3,SiO2]
d = [10,90]
```

The fdtd settings class is used to define the simulation settings. The
class takes the following parameters: - `simulation_time`: The total
time of the simulation in picoseconds. - `simulation_size`: The size of
the simulation in micrometers. - `d`: The thickness of the layers in
micrometers. - `n`: The refractive index of the layers.

``` python
SiO2 = [0, 0.6961663, 0.0684043, 0, 0.4079426, 0.1162414, 0, 0.8974794, 9.896161, 0]
AlO3 = [0, 1.4313493, 0.0726631, 0, 0.65054713, 0.1193242, 0, 5.3414021, 18.028251, 0]
n = [AlO3,SiO2]
d = [10,90]
settings = fd.fdtd_settings(200.,1.6,d,n)
```

The simulation is then run using the function is then run using the
function
[`fdtd_run`](https://gbeane66.github.io/fdtd_python/fdtd_python.html#fdtd_run):

``` python
wavelength = 3  # wavelength in micrometers
N_w = 20  # number of points per wavelength
settings = fd.fdtd_settings(200., 1.6, d, n)
fd.fdtd_run(wavelength, N_w, settings)
```
